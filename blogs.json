Cloud applications can be used as utilities over the Internet with a pay-as-you-go approach. These services are adaptable, dependable, scalable, and cost-effective.</p>\n<p>1. <strong>AWS Lambda</strong>- AWS Lambda is a computing platform (provided by Amazon)that enables customers to run programs without the requirement of servers. The user must simply develop functioning code in one of Lambda\u2019s supported languages, such as Node.js, Java, C#, Python, and others, and then upload it to Lambda. There is no need for the user to be concerned about running, configuring, or managing any servers. The code-running program can be simply scaled up in response to each trigger it gets. Because this is a cloud service, it operates on a pay-as-you-go basis, which means the customer only pays for the time his code is executing on AWS\u00a0Lambda.</p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/311/0*DjyhXJLTPj57R7QR\"><figcaption><a href=\"https://www.trinimbus.com/blog/multi-service-data-propagation-with-aws-lambda-fanout/\">Source</a></figcaption></figure><p><strong><em>Use Cases of AWS\u00a0Lambda-</em></strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Using AWS Lambda, we can quickly process and transform photos in a variety of formats.

On the server side, we have a number of virtual machines linked to this Virtual SAN, and they appear to be connected to a single virtual storage device, the data center, from their perspective.

Furthermore, because the majority of the features are housed in the software rather than the physical machine, we can utilize the same server for numerous purposes depending on the software loaded on it. As a result, it is feasible to package network functions in multiple virtual machines and determine where and how they should be executed. This is known as Network function virtualization or NFV. Similarly, when we virtualize this network by separating the control plane (the one that manages the network) from the data plane (the one where traffic flows), then we call it software defined networking or SDN. You may fine-tune networks for unique application use cases and apply security controls on each individual network using network virtualization.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Characteristics of Virtualization-</em></strong></p>\n<p>a) <strong>Partitioning-</strong> Multiple virtual machines are present in a single physical system during virtualization, and partitioning allows to separate these individual virtual machines from one\u00a0another.</p>\n<p>b) <strong>Isolation-</strong> This simply means that the host and guest machines must be segregated in order to avoid interfering with each other\u2019s functionality. This is done because of security concerns.</p>\n<p>c) <strong>Encapsulation-</strong> Configuration files, vmdk files, swap files, and a variety of other file formats are all found in virtual machines. All of these files must be encapsulated in one directory.</p>\n<p><strong><em>What are Hypervisors?</em></strong></p>\n<p>A hypervisor is a piece of software that runs on top of a hardware system to assist in the creation and management of virtual machines (VMs). It\u2019s also known as the Virtual Machine Monitor since it lets you allocate physical resources to virtual computers. On a single hardware system, many guest machines can be created, allowing users to run different operating systems such as Ubuntu, Linux, and Windows at the same time. The hypervisor also coordinates the interactions of the hardware and virtual machines.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Types of Hypervisors</em></strong></p>\n<p><strong>There are two types of hypervisors-</strong></p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*LSLSHYsa--m4eHpz.png\"><figcaption><a href=\"https://medium.com/computethecloud/virtualization-and-hypervisor-1f984296d071\">Source</a></figcaption></figure><ol><li>\n<strong>Type 1 Hypervisor (or bare metal)-</strong> The type 1 hypervisor is installed directly on the host machine\u2019s hardware and functions similarly to an operating system. This form of hypervisor doesn\u2019t need a base OS and can access hardware resources directly. This hypervisor runs virtual machines that are directly on the computer\u2019s infrastructure. Because there is no intermediary layer like the type 2 hypervisor, this hypervisor is very stable and efficient in terms of performance. Microsoft Hyper-V, Citrix/Xen Server, Oracle VM, and VMware ESXi are all examples of type 1 hypervisors.</li></ol>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*Zu7QPXQ8YxbTUGWG\"><figcaption><a href=\"https://www.flexiant.com/wp-content/uploads/Type-2-Hypervisor.png\">Source</a></figcaption></figure><p>2. <strong>Type 2 Hypervisor (or hosted)- </strong>The type 2 hypervisor behaves like a software application as it is installed on top of an existing operating system. This means that it is reliant on the host machine\u2019s operating system to complete certain tasks. Because the machine\u2019s operating system serves as an intermediary layer for this hypervisor, it\u2019s known as a hosted hypervisor. The type 2 hypervisor is less efficient than the type 1 hypervisor because it is dependent on the OS of host machine to monitor CPU calls, memory allocation, and network components.

Similarly, when we virtualize this network by separating the control plane (the one that manages the network) from the data plane (the one where traffic flows), then we call it software defined networking or SDN. You may fine-tune networks for unique application use cases and apply security controls on each individual network using network virtualization.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Characteristics of Virtualization-</em></strong></p>\n<p>a) <strong>Partitioning-</strong> Multiple virtual machines are present in a single physical system during virtualization, and partitioning allows to separate these individual virtual machines from one\u00a0another.</p>\n<p>b) <strong>Isolation-</strong> This simply means that the host and guest machines must be segregated in order to avoid interfering with each other\u2019s functionality. This is done because of security concerns.</p>\n<p>c) <strong>Encapsulation-</strong> Configuration files, vmdk files, swap files, and a variety of other file formats are all found in virtual machines. All of these files must be encapsulated in one directory.</p>\n<p><strong><em>What are Hypervisors?</em></strong></p>\n<p>A hypervisor is a piece of software that runs on top of a hardware system to assist in the creation and management of virtual machines (VMs). It\u2019s also known as the Virtual Machine Monitor since it lets you allocate physical resources to virtual computers. On a single hardware system, many guest machines can be created, allowing users to run different operating systems such as Ubuntu, Linux, and Windows at the same time. The hypervisor also coordinates the interactions of the hardware and virtual machines.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Types of Hypervisors</em></strong></p>\n<p><strong>There are two types of hypervisors-</strong></p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*LSLSHYsa--m4eHpz.png\"><figcaption><a href=\"https://medium.com/computethecloud/virtualization-and-hypervisor-1f984296d071\">Source</a></figcaption></figure><ol><li>\n<strong>Type 1 Hypervisor (or bare metal)-</strong> The type 1 hypervisor is installed directly on the host machine\u2019s hardware and functions similarly to an operating system. This form of hypervisor doesn\u2019t need a base OS and can access hardware resources directly. This hypervisor runs virtual machines that are directly on the computer\u2019s infrastructure. Because there is no intermediary layer like the type 2 hypervisor, this hypervisor is very stable and efficient in terms of performance. Microsoft Hyper-V, Citrix/Xen Server, Oracle VM, and VMware ESXi are all examples of type 1 hypervisors.</li></ol>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*Zu7QPXQ8YxbTUGWG\"><figcaption><a href=\"https://www.flexiant.com/wp-content/uploads/Type-2-Hypervisor.png\">Source</a></figcaption></figure><p>2. <strong>Type 2 Hypervisor (or hosted)- </strong>The type 2 hypervisor behaves like a software application as it is installed on top of an existing operating system. This means that it is reliant on the host machine\u2019s operating system to complete certain tasks. Because the machine\u2019s operating system serves as an intermediary layer for this hypervisor, it\u2019s known as a hosted hypervisor. The type 2 hypervisor is less efficient than the type 1 hypervisor because it is dependent on the OS of host machine to monitor CPU calls, memory allocation, and network components. Oracle Virtual Box, VMware Fusion, and Microsoft Virtual PC are some common examples.</p>\n<img src=\"https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&amp;referrerSource=full_rss&amp;postId=3aaf453f7f31\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" alt=\"\">\n","enclosure":{},"categories":["hypervisors","types-of-virtualization","virtualization"]},{"title":"Introduction to Cloud Computing","pubDate":"2021-06-11 18:48:05","link":"https://anav-chug18.medium.com/introduction-to-cloud-computing-dc16450ccef6?source=rss-9c844a0f097b------2","guid":"https://medium.com/p/dc16450ccef6","author":"Anav Chug","thumbnail":"","description":"\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/429/1*EqguEmz6gBSXxdIjCNr4Lg.png\"><figcaption><a href=\"https://www.bing.com/images/search?view=detailV2&amp;ccid=EqguEmz6&amp;id=9FF4FE09A053B27738851B358CDCA5E2225C87E3&amp;thid=OIP.EqguEmz6gBSXxdIjCNr4LgHaHd&amp;mediaurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.developpez.net%2Fforums%2Fattachments%2Fp486178d1%2Fa%2Fa%2Fa&amp;exph=432&amp;expw=429&amp;q=cloud+computing+png+hd+images&amp;simid=607988784495092946&amp;ck=46297014C240607C43DF1E6ADF0DE497&amp;selectedIndex=8&amp;FORM=IRPRST&amp;ajaxhist=0&amp;ajaxserp=0\">Source</a></figcaption></figure><p><strong><em>What is\u00a0Cloud?</em></strong></p>\n<p>Cloud can be defined as a sea of servers that are interconnected and distributed across the earth. In simple terms, you can think of the cloud as something present at a remote location. It is not a physical unit but a network of servers that perform specific functions by responding to the requests that they receive from their\u00a0clients.</p>\n<p><strong><em>What is Cloud Computing?</em></strong></p>\n<p>Cloud Computing is the means by which a user can receive computer resources and infrastructure through a network of servers to manage, process, and store their data via the Internet.</p>\n<p>Cloud computing has solved the problem of users who used to purchase or rent servers physically to store the traffic of incoming data. This is because the cloud charges the user only for the amount of service they use i.e., it works on a pay-as-you-go model. Moreover, the resources provided to the user are easily scalable and this is one of the biggest benefits of the cloud. Amazon, Google, Microsoft, Salesforce, and IBM are just a few of the well-known companies that use and provide cloud computing services.</p>\n<p><strong><em>Deployment Models in\u00a0Cloud-</em></strong></p>\n<figure><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/602/1*zXIy8zZs66JfG-8lxJ5Rpg.png\"><figcaption><a href=\"https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-36b70bbfd34b6ac544d72ee0d025715e\">Source</a></figcaption></figure><p>Four basic deployment types are specified based on the sort of access a user desires.
